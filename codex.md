## âœ… Task 01: Scan MO2 Profile for Conflicts

**Goal:** Read Mod Organizer 2's `modlist.txt` and active `profile` to build a full list of files that would be loaded at runtime. Detect and record all files that are overwritten by multiple mods.

### Steps:
- Load mod order from `<mo2_path>/profiles/<profile_name>/modlist.txt`
- Recursively walk each mod folder and collect file paths
- Track overwrites by file path
- Output JSON structure:
  ```json
  {
    "configs\\st_warfare.xml": ["modA", "modB", "modC"],
    "scripts\\sim_squad.script": ["modX", "modY"]
  }
âœ… Task 02: Build Merge Workspace
Goal: For each conflicting file path, create a subfolder in merge_work/ named after the path. Inside, place one subfolder per mod that contributes that file version.

Folder structure:
merge_work/
â””â”€â”€ configs/
    â””â”€â”€ st_warfare.xml/
        â”œâ”€â”€ base-walo/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ st_warfare.xml
        â”œâ”€â”€ gamma_patch/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ st_warfare.xml
        â””â”€â”€ runtime/
            â””â”€â”€ st_warfare.xml
Steps:
For each file path in the JSON from Task 01:

Create the folder path under merge_work/<file_path>/

Copy each modâ€™s version of that file into a named subfolder

âœ… Task 03: Merge Lua Files
Goal: Use Codexâ€™s merge agent to generate hardened, unified versions of all .script files found in merge_work/.

Rules:
Start with the base mod version (usually base-walo/)

Apply changes from higher-priority mods if:

They prevent nil crashes

Add useful debug info (e.g. SendScriptCallback)

Harden iteration (e.g. for k,v in ipairs(list or {}))

Fix real bugs (e.g. typo, missing handler)

Output:
Save all merged Lua files to merged_output/<original_path>.

âœ… Task 04: Merge .ltx and .xml Files
Goal: Use LTX/XML-specific logic to combine values from each mod into a single config file. Maintain compatibility while avoiding duplicates or unstable values.

Strategy:
Use lowest common denominator unless a fix is obvious

For spawns, timers, values: lean toward stability or base design

Consider agent support (e.g., LTXBalancer)

Output:
Save to merged_output/<original_path>
